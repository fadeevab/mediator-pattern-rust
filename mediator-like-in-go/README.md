# Mediator

## Mimicking a Typical OOP Example

This is a direct (naive?) implementation with Rust of a [Station Manager example in Go][4].

âš  I wouldn't recommend this approach, however, I think it's a good reference of how the Rust compiler could be tricked.

Key points:

1. All methods are read-only: immutable `self` and parameters.
2. `Rc`, `RefCell` are extensively used under the hood to take responsibility for the mutable borrowing from compiler to runtime. Invalid implementation will lead to panic in runtime.

See the full article: [README.md](../README.md).
